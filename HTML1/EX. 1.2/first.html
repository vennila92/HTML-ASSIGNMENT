<H1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</H1></CENTER>
<P>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming.
Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are
words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use
of new technologies, but not the other way around.
A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and
analytical presentation.
<P>Using the "View" option look at the source code for this
document. The background color and the text declared in the
body refer to a coding system that combines a system of
numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color
choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being
black. I could have just written in "white" and "black"
instead of these codes.
<P>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:
<HR>
<P>To begin, we can change the <H2>header size</H2>and <FONT
color=blue>color</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>of</FONT> <FONT
color=#008080>letters</FONT> seen on the screen.
The <FONT size=+2>font size</FONT>can be changed as well, and
actually gives more choices.
<P>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen.
This shows some
differing word types in a blocked quote.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif">
Now is the <EM>time </EM>for all good <STRONG>people</STRONG> to <B>come </B>to the <I>aid</I> of
their country. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">That was also
an example of a nested command. </FONT> </P>
