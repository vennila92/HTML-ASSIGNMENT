<p>So, my name is John, and I&rsquo;m a senior at School XYZ.&nbsp;This year, I managed to maintain a 3.7 GPA, while working on a few different school projects. I started an &lsquo;Ernest Hemingway Book Club&rsquo; which has up to 15 active members as of now. And I also launched a recycling program for the campus, through which we raised awareness and invited an outside guest lecturer to speak about the subject.</p>
<p>I tend to be teamwork-oriented and reliable, as I&rsquo;ve never missed a deadline. I&rsquo;m also proud of my ability to preserve and overcome any challenges as they come up. For example, last year, I was having some trouble with trigonometry. I realized I needed to dedicate more time to the subject, so, I met with a teacher outside the class and set aside two extra hours per day for the subject. Eventually, I ended up with an A in the subject.</p>
<p>At University X, I&rsquo;m planning to either major in English or Journalism. I love reading and writing, so I think both programs are going to be interesting and relevant to my interests.</p>
