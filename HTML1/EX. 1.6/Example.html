<p>A&nbsp;<strong>paragraph</strong>&nbsp;is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about&nbsp;<strong>paragraphs</strong>&nbsp;in terms of thematic unity: a&nbsp;<strong>paragraph</strong>&nbsp;is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea.&nbsp;<strong>Paragraphs</strong>&nbsp;add one idea at a time to your broader argument.</p>
<p>A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. <strong>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.</strong> Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
